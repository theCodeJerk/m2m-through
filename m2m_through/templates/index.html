    <h1>M2M Through</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to be able to use a through on a Many to Many table relationship.</p>
    <img src="{% static 'img/class-model.png' %}" />
    <p>The filename should be generated from the name of the first Publisher of the Submission.</p>
    <p>I can't seem to get this to work.  So this project is an attempt to solve this problem.</p>
